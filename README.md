## Overview

The Screenplay Pattern is a popular design pattern for software testing that tries to give automated testing a modular, scalable, and maintainable approach. It is based on the Serenity BDD library and has gained popularity in the testing community because it is good at producing effective and high-quality automated tests.

In this proof-of-concept (POC), we will be exploring the Screenplay Pattern in its simplest form and demonstrating how it can be integrated with Playwright, a powerful test automation tool.

While the Screenplay Pattern is an effective testing approach, it can be challenging to implement correctly, and there may be a learning curve for those unfamiliar with the pattern. It is also worth noting that this POC is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the Screenplay Pattern or Playwright, and there may be other ways to implement the Screenplay Pattern that better suit your specific testing needs.

Therefore, we recommend that you use this POC as a starting point to learn about the Screenplay Pattern and Playwright and to experiment with different testing approaches to find the best fit for your testing requirements.

Lastly, we would like to reiterate that the Screenplay Pattern is inspired by the Serenity BDD library, and we acknowledge its contributions to the development of this testing design pattern.
